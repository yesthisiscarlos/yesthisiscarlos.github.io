    "text": "Short Biography\nI was born in Chicago and raised in the Chicagoland area. My parents immigrated to Chicago from Michoacan, Mexico in the early 1990s. We came from very humble beginnings and somehow my parents managed to raise me and my three siblings while navigating a new country. Growing up we visited Mexico often and still try to visit at least once a year. Although I never had a strong pull towards a specific career, my parents wanted me to become a doctor. I didn’t follow the directions quite right because now I am a sixth year PhD candidate in Quantitative Methods in Education at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities."

    "text": "Research and Academic Interests\nBroadly I am interested in aligning methodologies to support test score interpretation and uses. This is a fairly broad interest which I split into a number of dimensions.\nFirst, I am interested in test development. In particular, examining new and existing approaches to measuring an individual’s knowledge, skill, and ability level. Developing culturally responsive assessment and assessments for special populations has been my main focus thus far. To this end I am employing a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to explore such inquiries.\nLately, I have been very interested in item response theory and what distinguishes it from other test theories. Particularly I am curious how ‘precision’ is defined in test theories. Additionally, I am exploring the potential for IRT models to explain polytomous item responses using item, person, and school characteristics.\nConnecting educational measurement to social contexts is another academic interest. I am driven to help and guide the use of measurement methodologies and tools. Educating others on proper assessment design, score interpretation and use, and statistical methodologies is incredibly important to me. I incorporate a critical and culturally response lens in my work and in my education."

I’m somewhat of a multi-instrumentalist as I can play guitar, electric and double bass, accordion, and hand percussion. I’ll be sure to post any shows or musical thoughts on here as well!\nCooking is another interest of mine. I love to explore and improvise in the kitchen. I worked as a line cook in undergrad and really connected with being in the kitchen. Making Mexican food and Mexican inspired dishes has been a great way for me to stay connected to my roots.\nLong distance running, biking, and swimming are some of my favorite activities to do outdoors. I’ve run a few half-marathons and finished my first marathon in 2023 (Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth). I’m also a member of the Twin Cities Running Club. Hoping to race in my first triathlon in the next year!"

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen will you be finished with your PhD?\nI don’t know. Hopefully sometime 2024?\nWhat are you studying?\nI am working on my PhD in Educational Psychology with a focus on Quantitative Methods in Education (QME). I am particularly interested in educational measurement. This is a field that is concerned with the measurement of a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities using a variety of assessment methods such as standardized tests, surveys, or performance assessments. Ultimately, we want to know that a score or rating is truly reflective of a person’s knowledge. Primarily, psychometrics (an applied field of statistics concerned with quantifying uncertainty in human behavior) is used to explain scores. Though, it is common to use more qualitative approaches as well. I tend to favor a holistic approach that incorporates evidence from both psychometrics and qualtitative methodologies.\nLong story short: data science.\nWhat year are you in?\nI think my sixth year? Time is a messy dimension and I prefer not to interact with it.\nWhat do you want to do after your PhD?\nIdeally. IDEALLY! I’d like to be a professor focusing my efforts on teaching about educational measurement. At a university close to my parents and family. Doing research on the side for fun. Realistically. I still would like to be in academia. Tenure track is enticing though I think I would also enjoy consulting or working at a research center. Alternatively, I would love to work with public schools either at the district, state, or federal level.\nIndustry work is currently not my passion but I won’t say never.\nWhat do you think about standardized testing?\nIt’s complicated.\nWhat is your favorite bear?\nThe brown bear. Duh."
