    "text": "Earlier this week I was lucky enough to see Vampire Weekend perform at the Armory in Minneapolis. As they wrapped up their second song lead singer, Ezra Koenig, spoke to the crowd and said “It’s been five years since we were last in Minneapolis. Can you believe it’s been five years?” And the answer is, no. I really couldn’t believe it had been five years. The following morning I scrolled through my photos and found a picture I took from their previous concert. Sure enough, the date said summer of 2019. It is kind of astounding how long I have been listening to Vampire Weekend. I recall watching the music video for “Oxford Comma” on MTV in high school (I think). Their first album, self-titled Vampire Weekend, came out in 2008. More than a decade later, I’m still a fan and having the pleasure to see them perform a second time. When they last came to Minneapolis, they were supporting their fourth album–Father of the Bride–and were also playing at the Armory. It was my first time seeing them live after many years of waiting to do so. I was nervous. I’m not one to usually get nervous, but I was afraid that it wouldn’t live up to the hype. I dedicated years listening to their music, following them on social media, and arguing in defense of them. What if their live performances are terrible? Rostam Batmanglij (producer and guitarist) had left the band. What if he was the real driving force? I don’t know. But once the band got on stage, I forgot about any premeditated fears. I hadn’t particularly cared for the new album, but seeing it live changed my mind and perception. It’s silly to think back now about how worried I was. The setlist was immaculate. Intertwined with hits and deep cuts, enough to satisfy the people who just wanted to hear “A-Punk” and the die hard fans who want to experience a 9 minute version of “Diplomat’s Son”. The encore, a sometimes cheesy experience, somehow outdid any expectation I could have ever had. They took requests of any Vampire Weekend songs and played them. What? This is what long time fans of any band would kill to experience. Atop the music was an incredible stage design and sound mixing. So, that was my first time seeing Vampire Weekend perform live. Five years later, I’m at the Armory again. This time they’re supporting the release of their fifth album, Only God Was Above Us, to a sold out crowd on a Tuesday night. This time around I had a different sensation of nervousness. It was one of anticipation. I was eager to see what they would do this time around. Will they do another encore set of requests? What deep cuts are going to make the set list this time? They’re changing the setlist every night, I wonder what we’re going to get? When it was time for them to start, the founding trio consisting of lead vocalist and guitarist Ezra, bassist Chris Baio, and drummer Chris Thompson, walked onto the dim stage, behind them a large black backdrop with the band’s name printed on in bold white font. The crowd grows quiet while the air begins to fill with excitement. With no warning the crowd gets hit with “I see a mansard roof through the trees” as the band kicks off with their first song. The trio plays a few songs off of their first two albums, as if to harken back to the days before they had access to complex and rich harmonies and instrumentation. As they play their final song as a trio, the backdrop falls to reveal a giant mountain tunnel and the remaining touring band members. Vampire Weekend’s set started at 8:45pm and went until 11pm. Nearly two hours of music varied enough to satisfy all fans of their music. Perhaps the most incredible feature of the show was their ability to reinvigorate classics through a new lens. We got an extended version of “Bambina” played as a pop-punk song, “Sunflower” got the full psychedelic jam band treatment which flowed between ska, indie rock, and electronic music. They ended their set with a song off of their new album, “Hope,” and vamped the end with each stage member bowing, stepping off the stage, walking through the tunnel as their spotlight goes out while the remaining stage members continue the vamp. At the end we are left with just the bass carrying on the final moments before he too walks away into the tunnel. I don’t know what their intention was with this ending, but I felt a deep sadness as I saw each member step off stage. As if they were truly saying goodbye and this would be my last time seeing them again. Of course after a minute of darkness, they all came right out of the tunnel ready for the encore. I’m giddy with excitement, hoping that they’ll repeat their encore requests as they did five years ago. To my surprise, they weren’t just taking requests of Vampire Weekend songs, they were taking requests of any song. Whether they knew how to play it or not. The result was a chaotic, funny, and impressive medley of songs that the band expertly carried along while Ezra found the right words. Fans were treated with two Vampire Weekend songs to finish the encore, as if the band knew they couldn’t end on a completely fun note. Five years had passed between the two shows. I’m in a much different place and a much different person than I was five years ago. However, I find it comforting to see a band I’ve known of for so long to grow and become different alongside me. It’s like seeing a friend from high school, that although we don’t see each other often, we can pick up right where we left off.\n{fig-align = ‘center’}"

We came from very humble beginnings and somehow my parents managed to raise me and my three siblings while navigating a new country. Growing up we visited Mexico often and still try to visit at least once a year. Although I never had a strong pull towards a specific career, my parents wanted me to become a doctor. I didn’t follow the directions quite right because now I am a sixth year PhD candidate in Quantitative Methods in Education at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities."

    "text": "Research and Academic Interests\nBroadly I am interested in aligning methodologies to support test score interpretation and uses. This is a fairly broad interest which I split into a number of dimensions.\nFirst, I am interested in test development. In particular, examining new and existing approaches to measuring an individual’s knowledge, skill, and ability level. Developing culturally responsive assessment and assessments for special populations has been my main focus thus far. To this end I am employing a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to explore such inquiries.\nLately, I have been very interested in item response theory and what distinguishes it from other test theories. Particularly I am curious how ‘precision’ is defined in test theories. Additionally, I am exploring the potential for IRT models to explain polytomous item responses using item, person, and school characteristics.\nConnecting educational measurement to social contexts is another academic interest. I am driven to help and guide the use of measurement methodologies and tools. Educating others on proper assessment design, score interpretation and use, and statistical methodologies is incredibly important to me. I incorporate a critical and culturally response lens in my work and in my education."

I’m somewhat of a multi-instrumentalist as I can play guitar, electric and double bass, accordion, and hand percussion. I’ll be sure to post any shows or musical thoughts on here as well!\nCooking is another interest of mine. I love to explore and improvise in the kitchen. I worked as a line cook in undergrad and really connected with being in the kitchen. Making Mexican food and Mexican inspired dishes has been a great way for me to stay connected to my roots.\nLong distance running, biking, and swimming are some of my favorite activities to do outdoors. I’ve run a few half-marathons and finished my first marathon in 2023 (Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth). I’m also a member of the Twin Cities Running Club. Hoping to race in my first triathlon in the next year!"

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen will you be finished with your PhD?\nI don’t know. Hopefully sometime 2024?\nWhat are you studying?\nI am working on my PhD in Educational Psychology with a focus on Quantitative Methods in Education (QME). I am particularly interested in educational measurement. This is a field that is concerned with the measurement of a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities using a variety of assessment methods such as standardized tests, surveys, or performance assessments. Ultimately, we want to know that a score or rating is truly reflective of a person’s knowledge. Primarily, psychometrics (an applied field of statistics concerned with quantifying uncertainty in human behavior) is used to explain scores. Though, it is common to use more qualitative approaches as well. I tend to favor a holistic approach that incorporates evidence from both psychometrics and qualtitative methodologies.\nLong story short: data science.\nWhat year are you in?\nI think my sixth year? Time is a messy dimension and I prefer not to interact with it.\nWhat do you want to do after your PhD?\nIdeally. IDEALLY! I’d like to be a professor focusing my efforts on teaching about educational measurement. At a university close to my parents and family. Doing research on the side for fun. Realistically. I still would like to be in academia. Tenure track is enticing though I think I would also enjoy consulting or working at a research center. Alternatively, I would love to work with public schools either at the district, state, or federal level.\nIndustry work is currently not my passion but I won’t say never.\nWhat do you think about standardized testing?\nIt’s complicated.\nWhat is your favorite bear?\nThe brown bear. Duh."
