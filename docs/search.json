    "text": "Hey!\nThanks for checking out my website. I’m Carlos and I am originally from the Chicagoland area where my parents immigrated to from Mexico in the early 1990s. My parents wanted me to become a doctor but I didn’t follow the directions quite right because now I am a sixth year PhD student in Quantitative Methods at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.\nCurrently my main research interest is in multilevel explanatory item response models for polytomous items. This is a broad yet niche interest that encompasses my passion for score interpretation and use, cross cultural assessment, and test and survey design. My goal is to equip and assist researchers with the appropriate methodological tools needed for their inquiries. I hope to continue this work beyond graduate school in an academic workplace.\nThis website is a vehicle for me to share my work with others, as well as provide an outlet for me to share some personal musings. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.\n¡Ciao!"

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen will you be finished with your PhD?\nI don’t know. Hopefully sometime 2024?\nWhat are you studying?\nI am working on my PhD in Educational Psychology with a focus on Quantitative Methods in Education (QME). I am particularly interested in educational measurement. This is a field that is concerned with the measurement of a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities using a variety of assessment methods such as standardized tests, surveys, or performance assessments. Ultimately, we want to know that a score or rating is truly reflective of a person’s knowledge. Primarily, psychometrics (an applied field of statistics concerned with quantifying uncertainty in human behavior) is used to explain scores. Though, it is common to use more qualitative approaches as well. I tend to favor a holistic approach that incorporates evidence from both psychometrics and qualtitative methodologies.\nLong story short: data science.\nWhat year are you in?\nI think my sixth year? Time is a messy dimension and I prefer not to interact with it.\nWhat do you want to do after your PhD?\nIdeally. IDEALLY! I’d like to be a professor focusing my efforts on teaching about educational measurement. At a university close to my parents and family. Doing research on the side for fun. Realistically. I still would like to be in academia. Tenure track is enticing though I think I would also enjoy consulting or working at a research center. Alternatively, I would love to work with public schools either at the district, state, or federal level.\nIndustry work is currently not my passion but I won’t say never.\nWhat do you think about standardized testing?\nIt’s complicated.\nWhat is your favorite bear?\nThe brown bear. Duh."
