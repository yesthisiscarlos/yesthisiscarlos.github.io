Hey! 

Thanks for checking out my website. I'm Carlos and I am originally from the Chicagoland area where my parents immigrated to from Mexico in the early 1990s. My parents wanted me to become a doctor but I didn't follow the directions quite right because now I am a sixth year PhD student in Quantitative Methods at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. 

Currently my main research interest is in multilevel explanatory item response models for polytomous items. This is a broad yet niche interest that encompasses my passion for score interpretation and use, cross cultural assessment, and test and survey design. My goal is to equip and assist researchers with the appropriate methodological tools needed for their inquiries. I hope to continue this work beyond graduate school in an academic workplace. 

This website is a vehicle for me to share my work with others, as well as provide an outlet for me to share some personal musings. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. 

Â¡Ciao!
