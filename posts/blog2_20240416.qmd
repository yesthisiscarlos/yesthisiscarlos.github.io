Hi! 

Some small updates since I have last posted. 

The biggest news is that I am now a PhD candidate and am working on my dissertation! Very excited to enter this phase of my career. 

I have been rather busy writing and preparing a number of manuscripts for publication. I hope to maintain momentum in my writing via these blog posts. Primarily in that I would like to be transparent about my writing process and what I have been struggling with as I write my dissertation. 

Also, my hope is to provide regular music reviews/recipe reviews/life moment reflections. In essence, I want to be rather open about my work and interests through this blog.
